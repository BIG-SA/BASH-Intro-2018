# More commands and tools

## Recap

Last week we discovered some key bash commands:

- Navigating directories using `cd`, `pwd` and `ls`
- Creating and deleting files or directories using `touch`, `mkdir`, `rmdir` and `rm`
- Copying, moving and renaming files or directories using `cp` and `mv`
- Finding help pages using `man` or the arguments `-h` and `--help`

We also learned some important concepts

- Tab auto-completion and using the [Up]/[Down] arrows
- Relative vs Absolute paths
- The `<command> <argument>` structure of bash commands
- Using wildcards `?`, `*` and `[]` to select subsets of files or directories

## This Session

We will introduce a set of highly useful additional commands, often known as *filters*.
Whilst the first session was mainly focussed on navigation around the file system, this week will be focussed on working with the *contents* of files.

Commands for today:

- `head`, `tail`, `cat`, `less`, `wc`, `echo`
- `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`
- `|`, `>`, `>>`
- `wget`,`curl`
- `zip`, `unzip`, `gzip`, `gunzip`, `zcat`, `tar`

Key concepts for today:

- Understanding text vs binary data
- Understanding `stdout` and `stderr`
- Compressed data
